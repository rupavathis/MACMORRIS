# About the project  

The MACMORRIS project seeks to capture the complexity and richness of early modern Ireland, by mapping the full range of cultural activity, across languages and ethnic groups, from 1541 to 1660. This largely bilingual resource provides the first inclusive account of creative, scholarly, and intellectual activity in a time of conquest, plantation, and colonisation. It opens a window on a world on the cusp of drastic change and puts in place the resources for understanding what stood to be lost in a time of dynamic and often violent encounter.
